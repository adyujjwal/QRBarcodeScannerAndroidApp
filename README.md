# QRBarcodeScannerAndroidApp

A college project where I developed a healthcare record checking system, I developed a QR code based card that contained all the details of the patient's medical history. This system can be very useful for doctors as they can know patient's medical history like medications, diseases, blood group and many more. Generally in the current scenario doctors have to waste a lot of time in collecting a patient's history also sometimes there are communication barriers. This android QR code scanner app is the ultimate solution to this problem as doctor's can use this android app to scan the QR code and get patient's history all at one place.
